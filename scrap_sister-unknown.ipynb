Many of the le√ßons are unique and I personally find them to be funny from time to time. Some few problems I have with the app include; being taught phrases that wouldn‚Äôt be used in the day to day conversation(even in depth)-the app having occasional listening problems despite my voice being clear(whether that might be my accent I don‚Äôt no)-finding myself doing the same set of words for a review back to back-& glitches that will cause me to close out the app and restart from the beginning of the lesson. It‚Äôs just a shame I wasn‚Äôt able to revisit France due to the World‚Äôs pandemic or I would‚Äôve been able to really enjoy the experience. Besides, it‚Äôs a splendid effortüëçüèæ\\n(Ps. if you could, add Irish as a language as well along with some other one country based languages.

       "  'review': 'I love this app. I‚Äôve tried others before and still have a few, but Babbel is by far my overall favorite. I also have appreciated the regular and effective updates. The reason for not having 5 stars is because due to my daily schedule, my free time is later in the evening. I‚Äôd much appreciate a dark mode. The white screen is difficult to look at even with brightness on the lowest setting. I searched the settings in hopes of finding that option but sadly, it‚Äôs not there. I‚Äôm sure others would appreciate a black screen to make it easier on the eyes for a last minute lesson before bed! My second suggestion would perhaps be some type of leaderboard? Maybe something to add a little friendly competition with each language community? One can only hope.   Everything else I enjoy and look forward to the future of Babbel! \\n Update: Absolutely amazing app for vocabulary, listening, and some speaking. However, some lessons being fully dedicated to grammar, word order, etc.. with some reading material, exercises, quizzes would be nice. I am noticing that even with a decent vocabulary and decent pronunciation, the lack of grammar knowledge in my learning language makes it difficult to actually create my own phrases. Rather than just repeat phrases from the course, it‚Äôs nice to better understand how to structure and put things together on your own! I never remember the little grammar notes buried within the normal lessons.',\n",

Since there is no true NEED for me to learn french and i was just doing it for fun, my mom would not let me pay for lessons.  In ads or commercials i have seen, it says it is free. I did the first lesson, didn't have any problem with anything, and I really love the way it teaches you! The only thing is I wont be able to learn anything beside, hello, goodbye, and how are you? Since im not aloud to buy anything.  At first i thought it was an add, but then i clicked away from it and tried to re enter the lesson, and it still didnt work! It really is a great app, but maybe you could give like the first tenn lessons free or something, and then you can give the option to buy the next ten lessons with money, and every time you get a question right you could get like stars or something and buy a lesson with stars.  Im just saying this for people like me who  dont want to spend their money on this app if they are not using it for anything, they should still have the option to learn!  Also, you should add a few more languages.  I was signing up and noticed thst there was only like six.  The real reason I downloaded it was so i could learn greek.

I used it for three years while living in Germany and had a yearly plan for German. \\n\\nI just moved back to the states and hadn‚Äôt been using the app for awhile due to the move preparations and process. Today I tried to use the app and consider switching to Spanish but all my German data was gone and it said my access was only limited. However, when I look at my subscriptions in my phone settings, I still have my annual German language subscription; yet when I go into the app and try to restore purchases there are none to be found.\\n\\nTried to find a way to contact a human through the app and their website, but couldn‚Äôt find anything.  I suspect the problem lay in the fact when I moved back to the States and got a new phone and US number it messed with my subscription somehow. But if I am unable to contact a customer service person, how am I able to troubleshoot on my own. My annual subscription was set to renew in 3 days so there‚Äôs not much time to figure it out before I get hit with another annual charge for something that doesn‚Äôt work.  So i cancelled my (non-functioning) subscription via Apple, deleted the app and came straight here to review. So take my fresh emotions tirade for what it‚Äôs worth.

I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a fan but the word scramble is OK. I love the stories. What frustrates me the most is that I am expected to remember perfect spelling of words I just learned and there is no room for any sort of mistake. Imagine visiting the home of someone that speaks a foreign language and you missed the slightest thing and get slapped with a ruler. Wrong. Any wonder why you might want to stop talking? I mean I spelled Waschmaschine as Waschmachine. Wrong? Yes. And the app is happy to tell you that. Pretty discouraging. I also don‚Äôt know that I agree with them using a non-Apple keyboard input because many mistakes I find are due to that keyboard versus Apple‚Äôs. I like the app and continue to use it. I just disagree with the beat down and I am frustrated enough to write about it.

       "  'review': 'rHi everyone at Babbel. I think that this is really a great app to help people learn Spanish. But the one issue that I have is that I am a black African American woman and I am a native English speaker. I have spoken English for most of my life, no other languages. But now I have just met a guy that I am seeing and he speaks Spanish, he knows English but he does not know a lot of English. So I have to learn his language so that he and I can be able to talk to each other and get to know each other. But it‚Äôs alittle difficult with this app because they teach you basic phrases but not enough to have a full everyday conversation and form sentences. Also some of the phrases that they teach are Stuff that you wouldn‚Äôt use in regular conversation. Like people being from Germany or France. I understand they are trying to make sure we get a well rounded education and that‚Äôs good. But I don‚Äôt want to be a pro at Spanish, I want to be fluent enough so that I can talk to my guy. I know i just started a few days ago and I know I am not gonna be fluent fast. But I am just saying teach me how to form sentences with the phrases I am learning. Other than this, I think Babbel is a great app for people who already know the language and just need to brush up on their skills, not really for a beginner.',\n",

The app also tracks all the words you‚Äôve learned and organizes them in your Review module for you. Then it will remind you to review your vocabulary regularly, offer at least four different fun ways to review it, and once you have correctly defined a word so many times, it takes it out of rotation for a while. \\nAlso, the different formats they use to reiterate the lesson ensures you can not only Understand the Spoken language but also Speak it well and Read and Write it too! It‚Äôs actually Fun learning with Babbel and feels like I‚Äôm playing a game! \\nIf you learn with Babbel for 15 minutes a day every day, you will be speaking a new language in 6 months!

I'm happy I switched to Babbel for building conversational experience. I appreciate the tooltips differentiating European/Spain Spanish and Latin American words. Those are helpful distinctions I didn't get in three years of in-person classes. Also, I appreciate the variation of native speaking voices. It's helpful to hear varying genders, vocal tone/pitch, correct emphasis and pronunciations.\\n\\nMy criticisms regarding the app and the experience follow: 1) There's zero forgiveness for slight misspellings/typos. A flag /warning before counting it against the user would be nice. We're learning here. 2) The matching games/exercises have a confusing UX. It's unclear where to drag and drop and the color selections are all gray, which is not helpful in guiding users through the exercise. 3) While I realise Babbel isn't aiming to gamify language learning, it could benefit from incentivizing users somehow. This could be as simple as congratulating or tracking your progress or improvements. It's very boring to see the simple fact I've completed x/100 lessons. Make it a little fun, and I will be more likely to renew my subscription. Without these improvements, I'm likely to head back to Duolingo.\",\n",

Unlike Duolingo, where I used the app consistently for an entire month and I couldn‚Äôt make it a week with Babbel. Key differences between the two: Duolingo introduces new words and how to pronounce them throughout the lesson, gives you the chance to master those words, how to pronounce the words, what it similar to more accurately, you can individually click on a word for the speaker to repeat. Whereas with Babbel, it starts of with you learning sentences and speaking it with no background which can be frustrating, the speaker repeats the entire sentence, in the middle of the lesson there‚Äôs an ‚Äúschool vibe‚Äù telling you the different conjugates forms, love the memory page aesthetic and give you different options, there‚Äôs no order to learn.

       "  'review': 'So far I‚Äôve been using Babbel for a few months. It‚Äôs a nice addition to Duolingo but I have a few complaints. One is the app‚Äôs recognition of pronunciation. If you pause to take a breath between saying the imperfective and perfective form of the verb it doesn‚Äôt recognize it as correct. The audio recognition is immensely time sensitive, meaning if you say the word too early or too late it won‚Äôt recognize it. For example, you press the voice button, it says the word and if you don‚Äôt repeat it in less than a second it marks it as wrong. Duolingo‚Äôs voice recognition is better than Babbel‚Äôs. Babbel also dumps a ton of vocabulary on you and doesn‚Äôt include it in subsequent lessons which even when you‚Äôre doing the vocabulary review daily like I am, makes learning new vocabulary difficult. It‚Äôs also giving words I wouldn‚Äôt normally use in conversation like hexagon and mold, etc. Would like more common language lessons.\\n\\nUpdate: So I just used the new speaking portion of the vocabulary review and I have to say it is a vast improvement! So congrats to the developers. It makes a lot more sense to hold the mic button while you‚Äôre talking and then release it when you‚Äôre done.

There are a few minor improvements that could be made here and there with the user interface but no two designers would agree.\\n\\nHere is my biggest peeve.  Babble asks that you listen to the dialogue between two speakers, and then asks you questions regarding the conversation.  Fine.  But here is the problem.  First, Babble introduces new vocabulary in the conversation-not helpful. Second, the speakers are speaking at full speed street level Italian.  My brain does not translate Italian that fast Babble!  Slow it down.  Finally, there is no way that you are able to see the English translation of the conversation.  I get it, Babble is testing your comprehension.  However, AFTER you answer the questions about the conversation we should be able to display the conversation in English.  Some of the Babble exercises do allow the display of English, but not the conversation exercise. \\n\\nI find Babble very frustrating at times and am thinking about ending my subscription to Babble and finding another app that is more to my liking and learning style.',\n",

I get that you can pay for a monthly subscription that re-ups each month, but that comes a higher rate as well, which in the end really adds up and may make it feel less worth it, especially since you may not know what you‚Äôre really getting for that money in the first place.\\nI just feel like this really cuts out a lot of potential customers and is borderline discrimination,  financially. I completely understand needing to make a profit, but I think it could be done in a more fair way- and if anything you‚Äôd likely be making more money as opposed to losing money over it. \\nBut, I just personally believe educational tools should be accessible to everyone. \\n\\nAnyhow, it is a great app from what I‚Äôve seen so far, and seems like it really guides you in how to have real conversation, rather than just being able to pick up on some random vocabulary, which is the case with some of the other tools/apps out there.',\n",

So I decided to get this app and committed to 6 months of full access (probably paid ~$30) After 3 months I have been able to converse and understand fluent/native speakers for the most part. Of course there are many more words and verbs to learn and understand, but it comes with time. I am on beginner course 4 and feel that I have made great practice, the recorded speakers allow you to hear the accents used and are much better than an automated version (computer voice). It is nice to be able to learn a new language on my own time, and even better when I can see the results pay off. I have received compliments on my accent and the amount of vocabulary I have learned in only 3 months. Would recommend for anyone trying to pick up a little French or other languages before a vacation, or just to try something you have never done. It can be frustrating learning very basic phrases at first, but if you practice them and look up words/phrases on your own you may be surprised how much you may learn.

I think I need to immerse myself in the language more for it to really come together in my head, but the app is serving me well. My issue with it, though, is how it handles pronunciation and that it sometimes requires you to mimic the speaker in weird ways. Often it will say I‚Äôm not doing it right, but I can pass if I mimic the pitch of the speaker while saying the same phrase. If it‚Äôs a woman, I as a man will have to speak in a falsetto and only then will I get the green box and happy chirp saying I correctly pronounced it. The teacher sounds laconic and, yes, a little sleepy? Don‚Äôt try to speak it in an upbeat tone. Lean back into your seat, slump into your chair and talk as if roused from slumber. Victory! So, yeah, sometimes it‚Äôs frustrating and you have to be more of a mimic than speak in your own tone and cadence‚Äîeven when your pronunciation is the same. Oh, yeah, and I‚Äôve bobbled some words but, as long as I‚Äôm trying to do an impression of the original, I‚Äôll get a passing grade.

I used Duolingo for about a year off and on but their sentence construction was absolute garbage. Duolingo had me saying things like ‚ÄúSk√∂ldpaddan √§lskar f√•lgarna‚Äù (the turtle loves the birds). I understand learning basic vocabulary and everything but these sentences got really ridiculous at times; not to mention boring and redundant. Babbel on the other hand provides real examples of phrases one might encounter in Sweden. And I love how they make me work for it. In later lessons, when teaching new words, it will bury the new word in a sentence full of words I‚Äôve never heard or seen. This was confusing at first but really introduces the context of the language as a whole and after a month of this I started picking up whole sentences that my partner would say on the phone to her parents. Well done Babbel, would highly recommend to someone who is actually trying to learn a new language.\\nBut just remember you have to be willing to try and fail along the way.

Babbel is the only app that adequately prepared me to begin conversational practice in a completely new language. It is my firm belief that language apps cannot teach you another language to proficiency. The only way to do this is to actually speak with native speakers. Thus, a language app‚Äôs primary goal should be to prepare beginners to start having conversations. Babbel does exactly that! Babbel teaches important vocabulary and basic grammar without expecting you to memorize huge amounts of information at once. It taught me grammar, the alphabet, and culture gradually as I learned conversational phrases. When I began conversing with native speakers, I was frequently complimented on my good pronunciation. This is because Babbel incorporates pronunciation practice as a feature and provides helpful pronunciation guides. This is the only language app that has demonstrably improved my progression in a foreign language. I would recommend it above all others, especially considering the relatively low price and the wide variety of languages offered.',\n",

What I was hoping to work on with this app were my speaking and grammar skills so that I could speak properly with people at work. Growing up, we would often respond in English or Spanglish so my communication never really advanced. I started on the intermediate section just to ensure I had the grammar basics down correctly. Babble starts off pretty simple and I was concerned it may be too easy, but as you progress the lessons really start to build on themselves.

You should definitely try to practice outside of the app to really get the hang of speaking, but overall this app is pretty good!

       "  'review': 'I seriously love this app! I am currently in high school and have taken Spanish for 3 years, I started to fail my Spanish class with a 66 and I was not happy. I didn‚Äôt understand conjugating, or pretty much any Spanish. I just didn‚Äôt get it, but then I started to use this app. Babbel teaches me Spanish in a completely different style, it makes learning seem super easy and fun. My current Spanish teacher makes everything memory based, remember conjugations, vocabulary, and more. But babbel makes conjugations seem super simple. It only teaches me the conjugations when I get to them. I just have one opinion, when I am supposed to write an answer down and I get it wrong, babbel immediately tells me the answer and corrects me. In my opinion, I feel like babbel should give you at least 2 more chances to write down your answer. If you still don‚Äôt get it then it can tell you. Thanks for reading! for future babbel downloaders, I HIGHLY recommend. Take this from the person who has learned more with 2 days of this app than they have  almost 3 years.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I am using Babbel to learn conversational Spanish. I can see why this will quickly help you get conversational in a language because it jumps right into it.  For someone who is a true beginner, this is too difficult and will make you frustrated because it spends almost no time teaching about things that make Spanish so different from English like sentence structure, word order, verb variations and masculine vs feminine structure, adverbs and adjectives. I should‚Äôve bought this after doing Duolingo for a 3-6 months.  That program is pretty elementary but for someone learning a new language for the very first time, you need the elementary lessons first. \\n\\nAlso, the voice recognition is absolutely horrendous. I get so frustrated with it that I just skip that part which then just launches the whole learning conversation so I have to go back and review it bit by bit. It truly is that horrible. Even when I say it perfectly, it doesn‚Äôt recognize. \\n\\nOverall, yes it‚Äôll help you get conversational quickly. However if you are learning a second language for the very first time, I would suggest a simpler program and then jump into Babbel.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Russian is a rather difficult language, and one that is presumably not nearly as sought after as French, Spanish, or Portuguese. However, the price for the Russian version of Babbel is the same as the the other versions but doesn‚Äôt offer nearly as much instruction as said courses. Furthermore Babbel doesn‚Äôt always fully explain why things are the way they are. For example, they don‚Äôt explain why the name for Germany in Russian is ¬´–ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∏—è¬ª (Pronounced ‚ÄúGermania‚Äù) but the term for someone who is German is ¬´–ù–µ–º–µ—Ü¬ª (pronounced ‚ÄúNemetz‚Äù). I suppose this isn‚Äôt too big of a deal, but language is all about context, and understanding the context and history as to why some words are the way they are is important to understanding the language itself, as well as just interesting. Babbel does a great job of marrying what works from other language softwares, but it doesn‚Äôt offer a particularly large amount of content, or grammatical understanding. Nonetheless, in my opinion it is the best language learning software out there for Russian, and I am satisfied with my purchase.',\n",

I chose Mexican Spanish but Babbel forces me to learn Spain Spanish, Chilean food, Argentinian food, and other unrelated topics which you cannot skip over. It also does not properly introduce new words or grammar conjugations in sentences. It will force you to fill in a words in a back and forth dialogue between characters but the dialogue will use words never seen before and you cannot click on the word to find out why it was used or conjugated in a certain way. The inability to skip lessons that don‚Äôt relate to what I‚Äôm trying to learn is beyond infuriating considering they are 40-80 questions per lesson.  There is not enough repetition of words or phrases so lessons are easily forgotten. My wife is a fluent Spanish speaker and agrees not explaining conjugation up front will lead to difficult to overcome mistake corrections later. The lessons are too vague, don‚Äôt have deep enough explanation, and there‚Äôs zero grammar explanation built in; coupled with lessons I don‚Äôt care about, I wish I hadn‚Äôt spent the money for this app. There are audio lessons with books which are much more effective in a shorter amount of time.',\n",

I have a PhD in psychology and so I can appreciate a good learning app. I really like Duolingo, for example, because they nudge learners using what we know about learning. After using Duolingo for almost 3 years I was ready to try something new. Babbel seemed like the obvious choice. However I‚Äôve been extremely disappointed. I‚Äôm an intermediate speaker and I was defaulted to saying hello and goodbye. Twice I took a placement test to be advanced to classes at my level. But the test wasn‚Äôt even a real test. Instead of seeing if u could speak Spanish by giving me Spanish to understand or statements to produce Babbel just asked me ‚Äî in English ‚Äî how good my Spanish is. That‚Äôs ok as a start but it‚Äôs ludicrous as a placement test. Making matters worse, the app is hard to navigate and it keeps offering me beginner lessons even after it says it places me at the intermediate level. Finally, so far at least, the content is boring. Duolingo uses humor and has inspiring podcasts with interesting life stories. Babbel has mundane stories that simply don‚Äôt engage me. Maybe I need to take a course in how to use Babbel but so far it‚Äôs a big disappointment. I‚Äôm giving it another week before I cancel. Brett Pelham',\n",

The Babbel app is really nice to use and I find the pacing of lessons to be quite good, though they are definitely longer and more structured than Duolingo. You do get a nice variety of exercises in each lesson and I especially appreciate the realistic conversations and the use of conversational French terms/slang. I do occasionally have issues with the app registering where I click (i.e. I have to tap words in the right order to make a sentence but one of my taps on the screen won‚Äôt register so I‚Äôll get it ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and have to redo), so I do wish the app was more‚Ä¶ responsive I guess?

So even if you say something with perfect accent, if the character dragged a word and you just said it, they will count it as wrong.

       "  'review': 'I have been learning Spanish with Babbel for about three months now and feel like I‚Äôm making good progress toward fluency. Almost all features in the app work perfectly for me, and I especially like the way it teaches new vocabulary and reinforces it through multiple modalities (listening, reading, writing, and speaking). The reviews between lessons help the content stick in my brain, but reviewing by speaking has been frequently frustrating. It counts about 80% of my recordings as right but randomly refuses to accept at least two or three every review session, no matter how slowly I enunciate the word/phrase. Even when I listen to the recorded speaker and pronounce the terms in exactly the same way, with identical cadence, Babbel still occasionally rejects it. Reviewing by speaking to practice my pronunciation seems like the best way to learn and retain the content, so I hope Babbel can fix this small issue. Overall though, I highly recommend this app.',\n",

The app‚Äôs pedagogy is sound: they use spaced repetition; alternate between listening, speaking, writing, and reading; and have native speakers dictate everything.\\n\\nThere are two problems I have with Babbel.\\n\\n1. Their user interface is horrible. The app looks like it hasn‚Äôt been updated since 2014. For example, when you finish a section, the iPad app just says congratulations- it doesn‚Äôt automatically take you to the next section. You have to navigate back through their fairly confusing interface to get to the next section.\\n\\n2. They have put minimal effort into creating a point system. With Duolingo, users compete to get the most points each week and reach different leagues, incentivizing users to spend more time learning. Babbel has an arbitrary point counter, but they don‚Äôt tell you what 2000 points mean and there‚Äôs never any competition.\\n\\nEven with these two faults, I believe that Babbel is the most cost effective and efficient way to learn a foreign language with an app and I would highly recommend it.',\n",

Also very strange that the text input lacks the ability to input accent marks, which are an important part of the language, when even the default keyboard on a phone allows. Why create your own keyboard that‚Äôs less functional? \\nAlso turns out that customer service is very much lacking. Despite the number of complaints here about speech recognition problems, all I get is generic responses about changing settings or blaming the issue on poor signal (sometimes repeating the same response I‚Äôve already gotten), and takes several days to get each one so no progress has been made since I wrote my original review about a month ago. Updated to remove another star. (Another update...developer responded here saying you can access special characters by holding the base letter, but that does not work. That‚Äôs how it works on the base iPhone keyboard but it does not work with the keyboard built into the app. Another unhelpful response)',\n",

Babbel does a great job pacing the curriculum by teaching phrases and vocabulary while they teach you the grammar. The only downside is that they don‚Äôt have a feature that allows me to drill my already learned vocabulary. There is a review tool that gives you a few words and phrases to revisit each day through listening, speaking, writing, or flashcards. I would love if they implemented a feature that allows me to drill vocabulary on my own with those same options available. There is the ‚Äúmy vocabulary‚Äù section where I can look and listen to my already learned phrases, but the translation is directly below.

Which brings me another idea for your language learning programs in this regard. One of my suggestions would be for the software to accept a gender for languages that have gender norms. The other would be regional pronunciation. I am looking to move to the South so I would like to speak Southern Portuguese, not Rionese (sorry I made that up).

Lately Babbel has been sending me a lot of sale offers, which tells me they want my money and have my email address, and also made me think they knew i wasn‚Äôt continuing. It feels like it‚Äôs easier for them to just take the debit and have people stuck in an old agreement than to be truly supportive of their customers.  I haven‚Äôt heard back from my emails and find contact is not so easy which also gives me a bad feeling. I can‚Äôt afford to learn the hard way for an app I never use anymore. Makes me so upset because times are truly hard enough right now.',\n",

I talked to a friend who happens to be Mexican and he highly recommended Babbel. I decided to give it try and it is soooo much better than the software I have as using. It has a relatively plain UI, but that‚Äôs fine for this type of content. The use of natural speakers helps ensure the proper enunciation. Pop ups point out subtleties that might otherwise be missed. The instruction provides more detail on the different genders and formal vs informal usage. Moreover, it‚Äôs done in a way that is easy to understand. I‚Äôm still relatively new to the program but I like it enough already that I upgraded to the all inclusive lifetime package. Once I get Spanish down I‚Äôll try another language.',\n",

I find the audio lags and will start talking even though I go on to the next exercise and the blanks you fill in are very small so it seems confusing what is wanted.  I don't feel there's enough repetition during the lesson before you are expected to spell or speak a word or phrase.  I may be wrong but I couldn't find a way to review a lesson's grammar unless you repeat the whole lesson.  I know it's not just about rules, but I don't want to memorize phrases either. It's not always apparent what gender or number you are supposed to respond with so I find myself getting frustrated.  Unlike the other programs, I am having problems retaining the information.

Like I said, had 4 years of Spanish, I can pronounce basic words like Me llamo, and mucho gusto. But not according to Babbel. Other times I botched the word and knew I did but ding!

Why is there no way to adjust features? This isn‚Äôt how I learn words in a new language. I need much repetition, and it serves no purpose in the beginning to be pressed to spell something weird correctly. Who cares? I‚Äôm getting so frustrated with it that it‚Äôs counterproductive. Also I keep being told my pronunciation is incorrect with very easy words, that I‚Äôve pronounced precisely how I‚Äôm hearing them - over and over and over again the same word. A bug. And you pay for one language and have access to zero others. Quitting even though I have paid for three months. Use Duolingo for free until the ads drive you crazy (and then subscribe) before this. Or Rosetta Stone where you can purchase lifetime access to all languages. Both repeat things a lot so you really become familiar with new words and concepts',\n",

I am shocked that an educational app would have so little consideration for folks like me with dim vision, or really anyone who‚Äôs vision is not, like 20-15.  Lose the white space and give us words we can read, please.\\n\\n3- I have studied and spoken Spanish for over 30 years, and native speakers are constantly complimenting my accentless pronunciation. Yet I cannot for the life of me get a pass on the proncunciation part. It‚Äôs laughable because I even speak Mexican Spanish (the accent of those doing the recording). I‚Äôve started to skip these sections, because unless you completely ape the recording in their over - pronounced, melodramatic delivery, it says basically try again. \\n\\nSo I think this app is for brand new speakers of a language with brand new eyes.

I‚Äôve found that the timing of when you speak is at least as important as what you say.  When I‚Äôve played back my pronunciation after being marked wrong, I found that my pronunciation was correct, but too early or too late for the very narrow recording window.  There have been cases where I‚Äôve felt my pronunciation was poor but I was marked correct, but much much more often I find myself recording the same properly pronounced word over and over trying to find hit the recording window properly.\\n\\n2) there needs to be more content on a topic and some structure to better explain verb conjugation.  The verbs and conjugations are shown, but patterns are left to the user to decipher.  The lessons don't emphasize linguistic building blocks enough, or provide enough repetition.\\n\\nA final gripe is that many other words are also presented fairly randomly.  Should I learn these?

On the final lesson, it told me I needed to pay, even tho I just started the free trial a few hours ago, which is annoying since I cannot finish the last lesson now. Lastly, unlike Duolingo, you have to pay in order to get lessons. This is annoying since a lot of apps don‚Äôt make people pay, but this one does- and the offers change every time you reopen the app! When I first got it, the big offer was 3 months, then 12, then 3, then 12 again. \\n\\nAs you can see, these are very annoying, and it‚Äôd be great if you could fix, or adjust these issues.',\n",

However, the app leaves something to be desired.  Compared with the other language-learning king Duolingo, the interface is a bit clunky, and the app is not sophisticated enough to account for typos.  The ‚Äúreview‚Äù feature is very useful, but could also be updated to repeat problem spots.  There are certain a words I ALWAYS miss so it would be more effective if these words showed up more often until I got them on the first try.  Even more, they could be repeated in the same session until the user names them correctly.  Having to go through a lot of vocab that I know like the back of my hand just to get to my problem words is annoying.  The technique used in Babbel is sound, I just wish the app was more elegant and showcased that better!',\n",

The app features  elegant images and up to date context in lessons and dialogues.  I am using the app for Italian language. \\n\\nMy Recommendations: Do not sign on for a year until you know if this app will work for you. The app is easy and engaging at first but it really moves you along. You will know by the time you reach direct object and indirect object pronouns whether you really know the material or care to proceed. You will likely need to purchase a good Italian/English dictionary, a grammar text, and maybe a book of conjugated verbs. You really need a strong grasp of grammar and the parts of speech of your own language for the app to click for you.\\n\\nAs noted by other commenters, the microphone function is wonky. I disengaged the mic when the speaking portion reached phrases and sentences. Too frustrating.\\n\\nNit: No real way to review without repeating entire lessons. No fast forward or skip function. Lesson titles do not contain subtext, so it is not obvious what items were covered. For example, let‚Äôs say you wanted to  review reflexive verbs, you could not easily locate that lesson in the app.',\n",

You guys do know that more kids would be using this app more right? Because they want to be able to talk to a friend or family member that speaks the language they were trying to learn. And some parent just won‚Äôt pay it. I think paying is really unnecessary. And really expensive.

I thought I was just saying it wrong, however it turns out the Spanish I was learning isn‚Äôt really used anymore, at least not here. My boyfriend said I was learning the old, very proper, Spanish that they speak in Spain (which is great if that is what you want). Unfortunately, this kind of Spanish does me no good in So Cal. Wish there was a way to learn casual, conversational Spanish with the slang used today, that would be much more beneficial for my needs.',\n",

I have not navigated the entire app but it seemed pretty clear than in order to progress to level 2 or course 2, payment is required...?! Already? Lol Yes, I see how babbel can get you going with some very basic conversations but do you really know what each word means? When learning a new language, you need to start from the deep down basics, otherwise you‚Äôll never truly know whether your using the correct form of each word, plural, singular, present, past, formal, informal. About the only thing I like babbel for is the pronunciation but you can easily just google translate phrases for free if that‚Äôs the case. There‚Äôs a REASON Babel is NOT ‚Äúeditors choice‚Äù on the App Store. Please do your shopping around before paying their ridiculous prices. THERE ARE BETTER LANGUAGE LEANRING APPS OUT THERE.',\n",

The lessons are short which makes it great when you‚Äôre in a crunch for time. I only have one complaint and a suggestion. \\n1) the app is very unforgiving with spelling mistakes/typos. Maybe a warning should be added rather than counting you out after the first strike. \\n2) I drive an hour to and from work every day with nothing but the radio to keep me company. It would be beneficial (for commuters at least) if there were audio lessons I could listen to within that time. Maybe a few conversational lessons that teaches words and phrases through repetition.

First of all it is the first app I‚Äôve ever had that would actually read to me what was on the screen. It read the word in English, my native language, and then in Spanish, the language I want to learn. The problem is that when I swipe left or right of the screen I have to go through every single word on the entire page because it will not read sentences. It takes an option out even when it is in my router to begin with. I have to go through and swipe until it says choose the correct but it actually says,\\nChoose \\nThe\\nCorrect\\nAnswer\\n And so on. Even when I go through the answers it doesn‚Äôt just say each answer as a complete sentence. It says,\\nMuchos\\nGracias so it is very painstaking to try to read the text and make a choice.\\nThen I got to the real serious bug that made me stop using the program. When I try to use the listen and repeat feature, my voiceover talked over the top of the person saying the word in Spanish and also prevented me from saying the word in the recording. I kept getting the wrong answer because it did not wait politely for my voiceover to finish talking.  Just like Rosetta Stone, this app is entirely ‚Äúblind need not attempt‚Äù.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a comment about the entire Babbel offering, which is a fairly robust and effective for learning a language at the beginning stage.  It has functional limitations in terms of becoming conversant unless, perhaps you upgrade to their conversational/tutoring services.  But, at that point, why not just join a conversational language group, which are available in most communities or online at a nominal cost. \\n\\nOf course Babbel, as any tool like theirs would, falls way short of its advertised promise that \"you\\'ll become conversant in a new language in just a few months\". My expectations were realistic in that regard and I don\\'t hold that against Babbel because if one was especially smart and engaged Babbel for 40 hours a week they might. \\n\\nWhat finally drove me to cancel my Babbel subscription after two years was their sudden infusion of left-cultural gender politics into the conversation exercises.  Being the clever and aggressive marketers that they are, I trust they have made a calculation re: the strategy of taking sides here and have deciding that a decisive shift to the left is to there advantage, as opposed to adhering to neutral ground.   \\n\\nI respect that and wish them all the best.

A \"real\" keyboard was previously used to type words. Now it\\'s custom buttons and they don\\'t work well. I constantly have to backspace because one of the letters I pressed didn\\'t register.\\n\\n2. The \"continue\" button now has a sound when it appears on screen. But it gets in the way of the app audio. Ex.\\n\\n- Sometimes the phrase is still being pronounced by the app when the continue button pops on and makes a sound (German language).\\n\\n- Sometimes the phrase is done being pronounced by the app but I\\'m still saying it aloud as practice (e.g. making sure I pronounce it correctly before moving on). There\\'s that dang continue button sound again! (German language).\\n\\nUnrelated to the recent updates are the pronunciation lessons that use the microphone. It does not matter how I pronounce it, it always tells me I\\'m wrong. My wife is a native speaker and even her pronunciations are wrong. What!??\\n\\nLike I said, great app and worth the money. But don\\'t make the app worse! Fix these issues and be more careful in the future. We are paying after all.',\n",

Then i started the lesson, it was pretty normal. although i didnt like how they made you spell, use in a sentence, stuff like that, after every word. the worst part was when they tried to make us PAY to do the next lesson! why should i pay 40 dollars for 3 months of an app i dont even like that much! i could use duo which is much better, free, and just easier to use in general. i do not recommend!',\n",

If you do anything PLEASE get rid of that - it‚Äôs stupid and annoying. It‚Äôs SO much harder to just click through from exercise to exercise - I have to acknowledge the stupid little ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great!‚Äù And then hit continue, then hit the keyboard button. \\n\\nFinally, when you‚Äôre on the conversation exercise, parts of the conversation get lost below the lower menu bar, so you have to keep scrolling the screen up to read through the exercise, and then you have to click back on the screen to type.\\n\\nThis is such a terrible update. I did one lesson and quit. I was really loving this app, but thinking of using something else. This is just a pain to use now.

It would be great if the score should reset when reviewing a level. Have an option in which the speed of the pronunciation is slower.

Babbel\\'s price tag is simply indefensible.\\n\\nMy main gripe with Babbel is the incredibly annoying auto-advance feature that prevented me from listening to a sentence featured at the end of an exercise as many times as I needed to. Too often I found myself asking: \"Wait.... What did he/she just say?‚Äù and then realized that there was no way of hearing that particular sentence in that particular part of the exercise without redoing the entire exercise again, which was  irksome, to say the least.\\n\\nSecondly, some of the voice actors they use are just awful and a pain to listen to. One guy in particular comes to mind..... he always sounded drunk and half asleep...... with his mouth full of food.

Even with my husband (who‚Äôs family is from Ecuador) telling me specifically to just use Duolingo, I got this app and paid for 6 months. Today is the first time I‚Äôve used it in almost a month because I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my money by not doing so, but it makes me feel confused and disappointed whenever I use it. The lessons are not simple or clear enough for someone not knowing the basics. Even my husband has sat with me before and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never use that in conversation‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about that‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never even heard that word.‚Äù Hmmm. I use Duolingo EVERYDAY. I LOOK FORWARD to using Duolingo EVERYDAY. I definitely have Babbel remorse üòëI hate it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I took the Mexican Spanish course and the first few lessons focused on basic vocabulary and conversation which was effective.

If you are planning on using this to travel to Mexico, it‚Äôs the app for you.  If you‚Äôre just looking to improve your conversational Spanish this is not particularly helpful. Focuses A LOT on spelling words that I wouldn‚Äôt use in everyday conversation - that‚Äôs not helpful. As many of the other viewers have mentioned, the voice recognition is bad - there have been times when definitely pronounced something wrong and it didn‚Äôt recognize the error.

It introduces vocabulary in an order you‚Äôre more likely to used and need it if you were to travel. They also explain vocabulary and grammar. But its not good at checking for comprehension nor giving you a lot of repetitive practice. In other words, new vocabulary is introduced too often in a single course. But Babbel gives you a solid start on learning a language but, you‚Äôll need more tools to practice and remember vocabulary. If you‚Äôre looking to purchase language lessons, I‚Äôd recommend paying for Babbel and using the free version of Doulingo for practicing vocabulary.',\n",

The app focuses heavily on European Spanish, which is fine, but it‚Äôs Latin American Spanish is seriously lacking.  While the grammatical structure of European Spanish and Latin American Spanish is fundamentally the same, the vernacular and colloquialisms are not.  The problem is that Babbel teaches it as though they are the same.  People fluent in Latin American Spanish can understand European Spanish, but they‚Äôll be scratching their heads when you say ‚Äúhasta pronto‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhasta luego.‚Äù   That‚Äôs just one example‚Ä¶ there are many more.  Additionally, Babbel‚Äôs lessons for Latin American Spanish are very rudimentary.  There‚Äôs not a whole lot of offerings yet, but they are adding to it.  Overall, the app is hugely disappointing\\n.  Save your money and stick with Rosetta Stone.',\n",

Not sure this app would make much sense if you had NO knowledge prior, as a lot of grammar etc. just has rules you have to memorize.',\n",

This is especially useful because now I don‚Äôt need to pay a ridiculous amount of money to learn Spanish at the college.',\n",

I like the immediate practical nature of the lessons, but I have significant problems with the voice recognition. You have to time saying the words immediately after they are spoken, and pronounce at exactly the same pace with no pausing. Speak too soon, too late, too slow or too fast and all are marked wrong without explanation. Several times I just wanted to uninstall the app. So while I like most of the app, Duolingos voice recognition is so much better and less frustrating.',\n",
